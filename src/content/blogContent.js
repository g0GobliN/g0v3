    content: `After finishing my first portfolio, I had an epiphany: wow, I really made this way too complicated for myself. Animations everywhere, hover effects, dark mode, Easter eggs it looked cool, sure, but maintaining it? Let’s just say my future self was silently crying.

So I decided to build my second portfolio. The goal: keep it simple, clean, and actually maintainable, but still creative enough to show that yes, I do know what I’m doing.

Keeping the Stack, But Kicking Out the Noise

React and Tailwind CSS stayed on the team because… well, they’re awesome. React makes components easy to reuse, and Tailwind keeps styling quick and consistent. But this time, I focused on cutting the fluff — fewer animations, fewer bells and whistles, fewer things to accidentally break at 2 a.m.

Minimalism Without Being Boring

The project section is now fully responsive, so it looks nice on everything from a tiny phone to a giant monitor — no more mysterious crop disasters. Dark mode? Of course — some habits are worth keeping.

Even the 404 page got a makeover. It’s still playful, but lighter than before. Because let’s be honest, nobody has time for a five-minute interactive 404 experience when they just wanted to see my projects.

Lessons Learned (the harsh version)

This portfolio reminded me: less really is more. A clean, simple layout often communicates your skills better than overcomplicating things with every new CSS trick you just learned. Also, I learned the hard way that future-me appreciates sanity.

What’s Next?

I’ll keep iterating, maybe add a lightweight blog or some subtle interactive features. The key takeaway? Simplicity wins, but personality still matters.

Thanks for checking it out! Feel free to poke around the projects or reach out if you want to talk web development, design, or just throw some sarcastic comments my way.`,
