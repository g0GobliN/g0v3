    content: `After finishing my first portfolio, I realized I made it way too complicated. There were too many animations, effects, and extra things. It looked nice, but it was hard to manage and fix later.

So I started my second portfolio. The goal was to keep it simple, clean, and easy to manage, but still creative enough to show my skills.

Keeping the Tools, Removing the Extra Stuff

I still used React and Tailwind CSS because they are fast and reliable. React makes components easy to reuse, and Tailwind helps with quick styling. But this time I removed the extra animations and fancy tricks that made things messy.

Simple But Not Boring

The project section is now fully responsive, so it looks good on both phones and big screens. Dark mode is still there, it’s useful and people like it.

Even the 404 page is simpler now. It’s still fun, but quicker to use. Nobody wants to spend minutes on a 404 page when they just want to see my projects.

What I Learned

This project showed me that less is often better. A clean and simple layout shows your skills more clearly than too many effects. I also learned that my future self will thank me for keeping things simple.

What’s Next?

I will keep improving, maybe add a small blog or some light interactive features. The main point is: simplicity works best, but personality still matters.

Thanks for checking it out! Feel free to explore my projects or reach out if you want to talk about web development or design.`,
