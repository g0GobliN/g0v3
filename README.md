This is my personal portfolio built with React and Vite. I made it to showcase the projects I’ve worked on, the skills I’ve learned, and a bit about me.

I wanted something that’s fast, interactive, and easy to navigate, so anyone visiting can quickly see what I do and the kind of work I’m interested in. It’s also fully responsive, so it works well on both desktop and mobile.

It’s basically a place where I can put all my coding projects together, share my progress, and give people a sense of who I am as a developer.
